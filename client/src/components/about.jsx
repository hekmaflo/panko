        Panko is a travel planning application built using the MERN stack. The
        name "Panko" is derived from the Japanese word for breadcrumbs,
        symbolizing the idea of leaving a trail and marking one's journey. With
        Panko, users can easily plan and organize their upcoming trips by adding
        the city they will be visiting, the places they want to see, and short
        descriptions of their planned activities.
